# Blocipedia- A wiki replica application with a premium subscription service.

## Blocipedia is a project I worked on during my Bloc Software Developer Bootcamp.

### Some of the technologies used:
    - Stripe API for premium account subscription payment. 
    - Pundit policy gem to implement multi-level user authorization.
    - Devise gem for user authentication. 
    - Emails were sent using SendGrid.
